        "Based on the analyses conducted, it can be concluded that both models exhibit similar performance in the task of ***sexism classification***. The overall performance of the *LLMs* is moderate, if compared with the model developed in the previous assignment. Indeed, the models achieved results only marginally above random chance (50%). This performance limitation is likely to be attributed to their general-purpose nature. When applied to domain-specific tasks without undergoing a task-specific training or fine-tuning phase, as in this case, their performance tends to degrade significantly compared to those models that have been fine-tuned for similar specialized objectives."
